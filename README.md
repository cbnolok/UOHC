Ultima Online UOP Hash Cracker

Simple tools to brute force hashed filenames used in Ultima Online UOP files. Adequately fast, but there's for sure a lot of room for improvement.<br>
The Parallel version is faster (if compiled with OpenMP support) than the Serial one, but it's by far more CPU hungry.
